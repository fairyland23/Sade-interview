      🔈 How does the struggle to balance financial constraints and the time demands of creative work impact your ability to engage in certain activities and maintain a conventional lifestyle?

    </section>

    <section  id="description">
        <p>
          
    
♥“You can actually find yourself with your hand down the back of the settee, trying to find enough money for ten cigarettes. But spending a long time fairly penniless is the only compromise I feel that I’ve made… It’s impossible to spend a lot of time on your work and also have a daytime job. And you can’t do certain things that other people do; you do have to miss out, I suppose.”</p>
    </section>
    
    
    <section id="description">
     🔈 How has the continuous commitment to work impacted your awareness of the potential experiences or opportunities that might have been missed during that time?

    </section>
 
    
    
    <section  id="description">
        <p>
♥“I don’t know what I’ve been missing, because I’ve never stopped working. “.</p>
    </section>

    
    
    
   <section id="description">
🔈 What specifically about the fashion industry do you dislike, and how do you manage to maintain an appreciation for clothes despite those reservations?
</section>
    
    
    
    <section id="description">
        <p>
          
    
♥“I don’t really like the fashion industry, to be honest with you. I don’t like the way it works, the way the buyers have so much power over everything—who’s their darling this week and so forth… I don’t like fashion, but I do like clothes. “</p>
    </section>
    

 
          
     <section id="description">
🔈 Why do you prefer to dress in a way that reflects your individuality, and what bothers you about the idea of encountering someone else wearing the same clothing?
</section>
    
    
    <section  id="description">
        <p>
          
    
♥“I’ve always liked the idea of trying to be as individual as possible. People probably think I dress in a quite conservative way, but it’s very much me. Besides, I hate the idea of walking down the street and seeing someone else in the same Armani jacket that I’m wearing. “</p>
    </section>
    
    
    
    
    <section id="description">
  🔈 Why does every performance on stage feel incredibly significant to you, and how do you handle the thought of an extended two-month tour?
    </section>
    
    
    <section  id="description">
        <p>
          
    
♥“It may not seem that way, but when I go onstage–and I know this sounds really corny–it’s like the most important concert every time… Sometimes I think, ‘How can I possibly be touring for another two months? I’ll be dead!'”</p>

     <section id="description">
  🔈 Why does your band prioritize doing things your way, and how does this commitment extend to creating music regardless of success?
    </section>
    
    
     <section  id="description">
        <p>
♥“That’s the one special thing about this band: we do things the way we feel we should. I suppose pride and ego have something to do with it as well, because you don’t want to make yourself look like a fool in front of 7,000 people… But we’re trying to express what we would appreciate rather than do what we feel is going to be fashionable… We would have made the same music even if we had been totally unsuccessful.”</p>

  🔈 What stands out to you as the most important quality in Prince, and why do you feel less brave in comparison, citing pride and fear as factors?
    </section>
    

    
         <section  id="description">
        <p>
♥“[Prince] is very, very talented, but the most important thing about [him] is that he’s braver than a lot of other people. I don’t think I’m as brave as that. I may be too proud and scared of losing face. “</p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="description">
  🔈 Why do you avoid discussing your love life, and what concerns or ethical considerations guide your decision to keep those aspects private?
    </section>
    
    <section  id="description">
        <p>
♥“I don’t really like to talk about my love life, because it’s like I have the power to talk about somebody I’m involved with or have been involved with or will be involved with and they have no power to defend themselves or be part of it.”</p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="description">
  🔈 Why do you sometimes believe that not having representation is preferable to being portrayed inaccurately or unfairly?
    </section>
    
    <section  id="description">
        <p>
♥“Sometimes I think not being represented is better than being misrepresented. “</p>
    </section>
    
      <section id="description">
  🔈 How did the press misrepresent you, and why did you choose not to address or correct the inaccurate stories circulating about your personal life?
    </section>
    
    <section  id="description">
        <p>
♥“Every time the press talked about me, the headlines were Lovesick Sade, Sad, Sad, Sade, things like that. They would say, ‘Lovesick Sade is shut away in her penthouse flat,’ as if I were Marie Antoinette. Anyone would think I had a moat around my house. Then they said, ‘Lovesick Sade is having a glass window put above her bed so she can gaze at the stars on her lonely nights,’ or something like that… And they said that I was having a dance floor put in my living room. They think I’m Barry Manilow! … I suppose some people would do a TV interview or something and say that this was all nonsense, but I didn’t do any of that.”</p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="description">
  🔈 That was it! Thank you so much, Sade, for sharing your thoughts and experiences with us.
